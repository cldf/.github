CLDF is [a specification](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/) describing how to store cross-linguistic data (i.e. data about (many) languages)
in a way that maximizes reusability. [pycldf](https://github.com/cldf/pycldf) implements this specification, providing tools to manipulate and
validate CLDF datasets, based on [csvw](https://github.com/cldf/csvw) which implements the underlying CSVW spec.

This GitHub organization collects repositories containing
- documentation about CLDF or
- tools to work with CLDF

For collections of repositories holding CLDF data, see [cldf-datasets](https://github.com/cldf-datasets), [lexibank](https://github.com/lexibank) or [dictionaria](https://github.com/dictionaria) or [search Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?keywords=cldf:Wordlist&keywords=cldf:StructureDataset).
